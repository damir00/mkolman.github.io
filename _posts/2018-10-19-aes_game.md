A set of various programming tasks waiting for you. Encryption of input files
forces you so solve them sequentially.

Is there a way to store private information publicly on GitHub? The data we
upload must be perfectly retrievable but only for the key holder.

# Advanced Encryption Standard

The answer might lie with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) which provides a
symmetric encryption for any binary stream. As a demonstration I devised a game
that utilizes encryption.

# Programming challenge

Here are a series of tasks. They are heavily inspired by some old
[IPSC](https://ipsc.ksp.sk) problems so if you enjoy this game, you will surely
like IPSC as well.

Each input is encrypted with [encrypt.sh]({{"/assets/aes_game/encrypt.sh"}}) as
{% highlight shell %}
openssl-1.0 aes-256-cbc -in <inFname> -out <outFname> -k <encKey> -base64 -md md5
{% endhighlight %}

To decrypt a file just add a `-d` flag to the end of the command. You can also
use JavaScript decryptor below.

By solving a task you get a key to decrypt the official solution and the input
of the next task. You can check if your solution is correct by calculating and
comparing the first 5 characters of the key's SHA256 hash.

The first task is encrypted with a two character key (its hash starts with
73475). Find it and you can start! And remember, __don't panic__.

If you are amongst the first three people to solve a task you can get your name
in the hall of fame above. Simply open a pull request for
[this file][github-blob] and add your GitHub username and signature to the
above table. [Click here to fork and edit this page online.][github-pr]

The signature for each task is the SHA256 hash of `<username>-<task_num>-<key>`.
For example if the solution to task 05 is `makarena` then my signature would be
the hash of `MKolman-05-makarena`.
